# Audience

The primary intended audience of this book is **intermediate** to
**professional** C++ developers who feel comfortable with templates and are
not afraid of template meta-programming.

In order to achieve all our [goals](#goal.md) of platform and runtime environment
independence, there is little other choice but to use templates with significant
amount of meta-programming techniques in order to allow compiler to generate
the best code suitable for the system being developed.
