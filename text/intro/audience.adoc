=== Audience ===

The primary intended audience of this book is *intermediate* to
*professional* C{plus}{plus} developers who feel comfortable with templates and are
not afraid of template meta-programming.

In order to achieve all our <<intro-goal, goals>> of platform and runtime environment
independence, there is little other choice but to use templates with significant
amount of meta-programming techniques in order to allow compiler to generate
the best code suitable for the system being developed.
