== Introduction ==

Almost every electronic device/component nowadays has to be able to communicate 
to other devices, components, or outside world over some I/O link. Such 
communication is implemented using various communication protocols.

At first glance the implementation of communication protocols seems to be
quite an easy and straightforward process. Every message has predefined
fields, that need to be serialised and deserialised according to the protocol
specification. Every serialised message is wrapped in a transport data to ensure
a safe delivery to the other end over some I/O link. However, there are multiple
pitfalls and wrong design choices that can lead to a cumbersome, bloated, and
difficult to maintain source code. It becomes especially noticable when the development of the
product progresses, and initially developed small communication protocol grows to
contain many more messages than initially planned. Adding a new message in
such state can become a tedious, time consuming and error-prone process.

This book suggests flexible, generic and easily extendable design architecture, 
which allows creation of a generic C{plus}{plus}(11) library. This library may be 
used later on to implement many binary communication protocols using simple
declarative statements of class and type definitions.

As stated in the book's title, the main focus of this book is a development 
for embedded systems (including bare-metal ones). There is no use of 
RTTI and/or exceptions. 
I also make a significant effort to minimise usage of dynamic memory allocation
and provide means to exclude it altogether if needed. All the presented techniques and 
design choices are also applicable to non-embedded systems which don't have 
limitations of the latter.
