# Final Outcome

The ideas summarised in this book are not just *theoretical* ones. There is 
ready to use implementation called 
[COMMS Library](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion#comms-library). 
It provides all the necessary types and classes to 
make the definition of the custom messages as well as wrapping transport data 
fields to be simple declarative statements of type and class definitions, 
which specify **WHAT** needs to be implemented. The library internals handle 
the **HOW** part.

**NOTE**, that the ideas expressed in this book are very basic ones, the
mentioned [COMMS Library](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion#comms-library)
is much more advanced than the examples provided in this book. It is recommended
to read the library's tutorial and, as an excersice, to think about ways how the
provided examples can be extended to support the described features.

The [COMMS Library](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion#comms-library)
is a part of a bigger project called
[CommsChampion](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion).
It contains generic plug-in based tools for visualisation and analysis of 
the communication protocols, which have been implemented using the
provided library.

There is also a bundling [project](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_all_protocols).
It lists all the open protocols that have been implemented using the
[COMMS Library](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion#comms-library).
