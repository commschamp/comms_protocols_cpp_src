# Final Outcome

Using the ideas expressed in this book I developed the
headers only platform independent 
[library](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion#comms-library)
which makes the implementation of binary communication protocols to be 
a quick and easy process.  It provides all the necessary types and classes to 
make the definition of the custom messages as well as wrapping transport data 
fields to be simple declarative statements of type and class definitions, 
which specify **WHAT** needs to be implemented. The library internals handle 
the **HOW** part. 

There is also a bundling [project](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_all_protocols)
where I list all the protocols that have been implemented using the library
mentioned above.
