# Final Outcome

The ideas summarised in this book are not just *theoretical* ones. There is 
ready to use implementation called 
[COMMS Library](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion#comms-library). 
It provides all the necessary types and classes to 
make the definition of the custom messages as well as wrapping transport data 
fields to be simple declarative statements of type and class definitions, 
which specify **WHAT** needs to be implemented. The library internals handle 
the **HOW** part.

The [COMMS Library](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion#comms-library)
is a part of a bigger project called
[CommsChampion](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion).
It contains generic plug-in based tools for visualisation and analysis of 
the communication protocols, which have been implemented using the
provided library.

There is also a bundling [project](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_all_protocols).
It lists all the open protocols that have been implemented using the
[COMMS Library](https://github.com/arobenko/comms_champion#comms-library).
