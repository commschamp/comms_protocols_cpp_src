# What's This?

This is a source repository for the 
[Guide to Implementing Communication Protocols in C++](https://commschamp.github.io/comms_protocols_cpp)
free e-book.

The book text is written in [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/) 
format and uses [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) to generate both PDF and 
HTML versions of the book. The used diagrams require [Dia](http://dia-installer.de/) to convert them
to images. 

The project needs to be built using [CMake](https://cmake.org).
